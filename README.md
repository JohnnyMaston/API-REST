# API-REST
+Support for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

+Property of Juan Jose Herrera Salda√±a

+Simple REST API where there is support for GET, POST, UPDATE and DELETE.
+Thought to connect the database ('MongoDB') but you can edit it yourself, javascript programmer requires nodejs for the server to work, the frontend is not programmed, you +must do it yourself, I recommend angular.
